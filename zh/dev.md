# 安裝必要軟體
1. 下載 [Git](https://git-scm.com/)。
2. 下載  <ahref="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> (comes with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)).
3. Install [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links) (open a terminal and type `npm install -g typescript`).

# Cloning the project
1. Open a terminal and type `git clone URL`. **Replace URL with repository link you want to contribute to** e.g. `git clone https://github.com/PreMiD/PreMiD`.
2. Choose a folder of your choice.
3. 在你寫程式的軟件開。

# Installing dependencies
> Be sure you have installed [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager) first. It automatically installed itself if you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. 
> 
> {.is-warning}

- Open a terminal in your repository and type `npm i`.
- To update the dependencies type `npm update`.

> Be aware that updating the dependencies could break a lot, or not - testing is required!

> {.is-danger}

# Coding your vision
Please keep the structure. We do not want to disorganize our project. 混亂的檔案不接受。

# 正在提交你的夢想
Just open a Pull Request on one of our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/PreMiD/) you want to contribute to. We will take care of your baby, don't worry. If this is your first time making a pull request, take a look at this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

# Getting approved
Our main goal is to work with users so try to be as much friendly, respectful and informative as possible. Just ping a Developer in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WvfVZ8T) to get that review on GitHub, or not. Depends on the code quality, appearance of assets and regular functionality.
