The installation of the extension is very important as the application can not do anything by itself.

# Installer
1. Go to our downloads page by [clicking here](https://premid.app/downloads).
2. Velg **Firefox**.
3. Søk for `about:addons`.
4. Click on the small gear icon in the upper right corner.
5. Choose **Install add-on from file**.
6. Velg filen du lastet ned nylig.
7. Accept the installation by clicking on **Add**.

> Ikke glem å [legge til** applikasjonen**](/install).
