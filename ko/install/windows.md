The installation of the application is very important as the extension can not do anything by itself.

# 설치
1. [이곳](https://premid.app/downloads) 을 눌러 다운로드 하세요!
2. **Windows**를 선택하세요.
3. 설치파일을 여세요!
4. **Windows SmartScreen** will appear, if you install PreMiD for the first time. Click on **More Info** and then select **Run Anyway**. > This is because we do not have a Code Signing Certificate (CSC). [Support us](https://www.patreon.com/Timeraa) to fund it.{.is-info}

The application will start automatically. Check for the symbol in your system tray.

> Do not forget to [add the **extension**](/install).{.is-warning}
